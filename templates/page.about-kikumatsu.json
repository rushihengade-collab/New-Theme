The wood ash is made in-house from pesticide-free thinned wood, which is burned to ash, sieved, and refined. Wood ashis a coagulant that determines the shelf life of konjac, but unlike slaked lime, which is artificially refined and has stable quality, wood ash is natural and therefore subject to variation. Despite this, we went through repeated trial and error until we were able to produce thousands of pieces of product with consistent quality."
